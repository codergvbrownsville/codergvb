What happens at a Meetup?
The Code#RGV Brownsville: Meetup starts every first and third Tuesday at 7:00 pm. We meet at The WorkPub on 847 East Elizabeth Street. The event is free and open to anyone, especially folks who aren’t programmers.

6:30 pm – Get Settled
Free food is always provided at our Meetups. Come around 6:30 pm to get settled and grab a drink and a slice of pizza, wings, sandwich or wrap. We try to always have healthy options available.

7:00 pm – Welcome and Presentation + Q&A
We officially start at 7:00 pm with a brief presentation followed by a question/answer session. Anyone can propose a talk. Let us know if you have something to say!

7:30 pm - Introductions
Everyone in the room introduces themselves and tells the group why they’re at the Meetup.

7:45 pm – Announcements
In the announcements section, we encourage folks to introduce other events, mention newsworthy articles, and technology-related job announcements. We record these announcements in our weekly meeting notes and agenda Google Doc.

8:00 pm – 10:00 pm - Open Social + Working Session
At this point, the event switches to an open social + working session. People are invited to break off into groups and work on projects, or join one of our classes hosted by members of Code#RGV: Brownsville. Want to host a class? Tell us!

10:00 pm - Move to El Hueso de Fraile
At this point, there’s usually a tenacious group of folks that migrate next door to El Hueso de Fraile to continue working or socializing.

Hope to see you there!
