#Suggested Challenges:
*Note:* These are only _Suggested Challenges_. We encourage you to consider the vast quantity of publicly available data in the Rio Grande Valley and projects you may have local expertise in. There is no need to use a challenge from this list.

+ ####**Border wait time planning**
Create a tool to help families in the Rio Grande Valley plan border crossings on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.

+ ####**Ambulance estimated time of arrival**
Create a tool that is able to use the (1) GPS location of an ambulance, and (2) GPS location of a destination to provide an estimated time for ambulance arrival to a hospital Emergency Room

+ ####**Population health dashboard**
Create a population health dashboard for health departments in the Rio Grande Valley based on common diseases in the Rio Grande Valley. Data will be available from the Rio Grande Valley Health Information Exchange. You can also assume and use the [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) and the [HAPI FHIR sample FHIR database](http://hapifhir.io/).
 + ####**Datasets**
 [Sample CCDAs](https://github.com/jmandel/sample_ccdas)
<a href="/user/pages/05.hackathon/pdfs/RHP5-Needs-Assessment-2012.pdf" download>Rio Grande Valley Needs Assessment</a>

+ ####**CCDA data parser**
Create or implement an XML data parser for Continuity of Care Document Architecture (CCDA) documents to allow the Rio Grande Valley Health Information Exchange to move past only storing original clinical documents. RGV HIE wishes to parse medical data from CCDs and load them into a structured data model.
 + ####**Datasets**

+ ####**Make RGV bus route data available for Google Maps to consume**
Convert PDF and text bus route data for bus routes in the Rio Grande Valley to the [The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) separated by city and county in order for city and county government to make these files public and available to Google for integration with Google Maps for route planning in the Rio Grande Valley.
 + ####**Datasets**
[Brownsville Bus Routes - MetroConnect](https://www.cob.us/701/Regional-Transportation)
[Brownsville System-wide Map](https://www.cob.us/DocumentCenter/View/4017)

+ ####**Water quality data dashboard for the Rio Grande Valley**
Use public annual water quality reports from cities in the Rio Grande Valley to create a tool for residents of the Rio Grande Valley to use to monitor water quality. Liberate these data from PDFs!
 + ####**Datasets**
[Laguna Madre Water District - 2015](http://lagunamadrewater.com/Portals/0/2015%20Annual%20Drinking%20Water%20Quality%20Report%20TX0310005_2015_2016-05-26_11-26-23%286%29_1.pdf)

Project can include digitizing and categorizing Cameron County Department of Health and Human Services Resource Directory. Extra features would include the ability for a case worker to login and make a list of resources they have a relationship with.
