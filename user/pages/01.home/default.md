Code#RGV: Brownsville is a technology group in Brownsville part of (Code#RGV)[http://www.codergv.org/] held on the first and third Tuesday of every month. We aim to bring together people interested in technology and provide an environment where they can work on projects, learn new skills, socialize, and volunteer for the community.
